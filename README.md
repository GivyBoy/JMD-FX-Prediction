# JMD-FX-Prediction
This repository holds the code that I used to try and predict the Jamaican Dollar versus its main trading currencies (USD, GBP, etc.). I scraped the data from the Bank of Jamaica's website (which they updated, sadly), so this code won't work anymore. I used a MultiLinear Regression to achieve my results.

The `financefunctions.py` file holds a lot of financial analysis code that I wrote to make my life easier when researching equities.
